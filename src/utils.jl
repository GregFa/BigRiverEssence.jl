	SignConsistency_opt!(V)

Fix the sign of each column of a loading matrix so the largest-magnitude entry is
positive, in place
# Arguments
- `V`: 2d array of floats; the loading/direction matrix whose columns are sign-fixed
  in place
# Value
The matrix `V`, with each column multiplied by ±1 so that its entry of largest
absolute value is positive. SVD- and eigen-derived directions are only determined
up to a sign, so this canonicalizes the choice to make results reproducible across
runs and comparable across implementations. An all-zero column (whose largest
entry has sign 0) is left untouched
