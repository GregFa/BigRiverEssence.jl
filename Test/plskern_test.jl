# Test/plskern_test.jl — tests for plskern (Dayal & MacGregor 1997 kernel PLS) and
# its companions plskerncoef / plskernpredict / plskerntransform.
# Tolerances (tol_ord / tol_julia / tol_r) come from runtests.jl: tol_ord for exact
# linear-algebra identities, tol_julia for the cross-implementation Jchemo checks.
#
# NOTE: plskern is IN-PLACE — it overwrites both X and Y. Two cautions recur below:
#   • fit on copy(X) so the original X survives for the assertions that reuse it.
#   • for a single response, pass reshape(copy(y), :, 1). reshape ALONE returns a
#     VIEW sharing y's memory, so the in-place fit would centre y itself and corrupt
#     it — copy(y) FIRST, then reshape, gives the fit its own matrix to mutate.
